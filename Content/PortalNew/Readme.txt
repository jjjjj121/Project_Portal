Hey everyone!


Thank you for downloading my portal code.  The rendering is pretty solid as long as the camera doesn't
clip through walls or objects, but the teleportation is a little iffy.


To add to your game, just drag the FirstPersonBP folder into your content directory.
If you don't have this folder there already, drag it in anyways (adding assets individually can break your game).


If your codebase doesn't start with the first person character starter content, you must disable the branch of each teleportation
block that references the first person character in the Portal Holder blueprint.  You'll probably have to add your own code to get everything working smoothly as well.


I'd appreciate if you credited me with creating this code, like a link to my youtube channel would be great! (TheLegomaster86 or Steven)


Anyways, enjoy!!!
